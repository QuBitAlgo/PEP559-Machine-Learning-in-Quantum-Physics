# Assignment #2

## Question 1: Experimenting with MLP Training  
Test the uploaded code **"demo_MLP_intro.ipynb"** and analyze its performance.  

- Test the accuracy for different learning rates and iterations. Generate a contour plot of the accuracy in the plane of **"iteration (or epoch)"** and **"learning rate."**
- Test the performance for different numbers of neurons in the **hidden** layer.
- Test the performance of the neural network with **two hidden layers**.

**Assessment**: Submission is not required. At the beginning of the next lecture, you will need to discuss the code implementation and the analysis of your results.
